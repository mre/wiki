# Vim

Actually I use [neovim](https://neovim.io/) which is a fork of vim that **just works**. You can find my configuration [here](https://github.com/lucasprag/vimlociraptor).

## after ~6 years using vim

Vim is great, but it's not a boost in productivity by itself. What boosts productivity IMO is:

* use a fast text editor \(like vim, sublime text, emacs\)
* learn **every single** shortcut and feature
* extend your editor by writing commands, snippets, plugins
* be focused on getting things done

* [Intermediate Vim](https://mkaz.blog/code/intermediate-vim/) by Marcus Kazmierczak \(actually, itâ€™s quite basic, it goes from modes to movements to macros\)
