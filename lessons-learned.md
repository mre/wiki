# Lessons

## back to the beginning

If you want to learn more about a technology \(or concept, etc\), try to learn from who created it.

This is nice because you can see more about why things are the way they are.

Try not _only_ learn from people who teach about it but not actually understand it deeply.

## over engineering

I can't tell how much times I saw myself and others worrying too much about scaling the app to early resulting in over engineered projects.

I try to always keep in mind to do the simplest thing first \(with good sense\) and only scale when needed.
